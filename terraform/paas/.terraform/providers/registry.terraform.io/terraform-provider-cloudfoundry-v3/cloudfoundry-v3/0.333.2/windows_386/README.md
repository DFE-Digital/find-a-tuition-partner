# Cloud Foundry Terraform Provider (v3 API)

Experimental implementation of terraform resource for rolling deployments of
cloudfoundry applications using the v3 API.

Long-term intention is to contribute back
[upstream](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/terraform-provider-cloudfoundry).
This is the minimum viable
chunk to meet our immediate need.
