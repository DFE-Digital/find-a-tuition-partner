# Importing Tuition Partner Data

## Description

The service relies on an import of Tuition Partner data from Excel spreadsheets stored in Google Drive. These spreadsheets are maintained by the Business Analysts and Product Managers on the team. The [`DataImporterService`](/Infrastructure/DataImporterService.cs) class retrieves the spreadsheets directly from Google Drive, parses the data and creates a Tuition Partner from each one in the database.

The data importer also runs the migrations against the database prior to the import to update the schema.

## Data files and logos

The Tuition Partner Excel spreadsheets are managed in the üóÄ `NTP` ‚ù± `Tuition Partner Data & Information` ‚ù± `TP Data - Beta` ‚ù± `FINAL Data Responses` folder in Google Drive. The logos are stored in the üóÄ `NTP` > `Tuition Partner Data & Information` ‚ù± `TP Data - Beta` ‚ù± `Logos` folder using filenames that contain the kebab cased version of the Tuition Partner's name. The ids for the drive and folders are stored in the following GitHub Actions secrets which are converted to environment variables when deployed:

- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_SHARED_DRIVE_ID` - "School Services" drive id
- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_TUITION_PARTNER_DATA_FOLDER_ID` - Tuition Partner "FINAL Data Responses" folder id
- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_TUITION_PARTNER_LOGO_FOLDER_ID` - Tuition Partner "Logos" folder id

## Google Cloud project service account key

The service uses a Google Cloud service account to access the folders. This service account has been granted access to export and download the spreadsheets and logos in these folders. The service identifies as this service account using a key. This key is stored in the `GOOGLE_DRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` GitHub Actions secret and this secret is written out as a file during deployment.

### Rotating service account key

This is covered in the Secrets document in Google Drive.
